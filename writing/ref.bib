As an example we encode a version of Mini-ML with mutable references including its type system and its operational semantics and describe how to take practical advantage of the representation of its computations.}

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               The theory of types is intended to be a full-scale system for formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed. The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.}

It aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. Lean is an ongoing and long-term effort, but it already provides many useful components, integrated development environments, and a rich API which can be used to embed it into other systems. It is currently being used to formalize category theory, homotopy type theory, and abstract algebra. We describe the project goals, system architecture, and main features, and we discuss applications and continuing work.},
